DVS unit architecture:
It has three components 1) MicroBlaze (MB) processor, 2) a register file using a dual port Ram (DPRAM) 3) I2C IP core
All three are connected to local Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) bus.
It has full capabilities of power rails connected to the PMBus.
MB processor is mainly  because of the relatively complexity of I2C communications that means that a state machine implementation will
be  complex to design and mantain for different boards with slight PMBus implementation differences.
